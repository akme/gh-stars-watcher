# GitHub Stars Watcher Constitution

## Core Principles

### I. Code Quality Standards
All code MUST follow idiomatic Go practices as defined in `.github/instructions/go.instructions.md`. Every function, struct, and package MUST be documented with clear purpose and usage examples. Code complexity MUST be minimized - functions exceeding 20 lines or 4 levels of indentation require architectural justification. All exported APIs MUST be reviewed for clarity and necessity before merge.

*Rationale: Maintainable, readable code reduces technical debt and enables reliable feature development. Go's idioms ensure consistency across the codebase.*

### II. Testing Excellence (NON-NEGOTIABLE)
Test-Driven Development is mandatory: Write failing tests → Implement minimum code to pass → Refactor. All features MUST achieve 90%+ code coverage with meaningful assertions, not just execution coverage. Integration tests MUST cover GitHub API interactions, rate limiting, and error scenarios. Performance tests MUST validate all operations complete within defined SLA thresholds.

*Rationale: GitHub API monitoring requires reliability and predictable behavior. Comprehensive testing prevents production failures and ensures graceful degradation.*

### III. User Experience Consistency
CLI interface MUST provide consistent flag patterns, help text, and output formats across all commands. JSON output MUST be available for programmatic usage alongside human-readable formats. Error messages MUST be actionable with clear resolution steps. Progress indicators MUST be shown for long-running operations (>2 seconds). All user interactions MUST gracefully handle network failures and API rate limits.

*Rationale: Users depend on reliable tooling for monitoring workflows. Consistent interfaces reduce learning curve and enable automation.*

### IV. Performance Requirements
GitHub API requests MUST respect rate limits with exponential backoff. Local data caching MUST minimize redundant API calls while ensuring data freshness. Memory usage MUST remain under 50MB for typical monitoring scenarios (up to 1000 repositories). Startup time MUST be under 500ms for cached operations, under 2s for fresh data fetches. All performance metrics MUST be validated in automated tests.

*Rationale: Efficient resource usage enables continuous monitoring without impacting GitHub API quotas or local system performance.*

## Development Standards

**Architecture Requirements**: Follow clean architecture patterns with clear separation between GitHub API clients, business logic, and CLI presentation layers. All external dependencies MUST be abstracted behind interfaces to enable testing and potential service switching.

**Security Standards**: GitHub tokens MUST be stored securely using OS keychain integration. All HTTP communications MUST use TLS 1.2+. Input validation MUST sanitize all user-provided repository names and filtering criteria.

**Documentation Standards**: All public APIs MUST include usage examples. README MUST contain quickstart guide completing a full monitoring workflow in under 5 minutes. Architecture decisions MUST be documented in `/docs/architecture/` with rationale and trade-offs.

## Quality Assurance

**Code Review Process**: All changes require review focusing on principle compliance, test coverage, and performance impact. Reviewers MUST verify tests fail before implementation and pass after completion. Performance regression tests MUST pass on each PR.

**Release Validation**: Each release MUST complete end-to-end validation against live GitHub API including error scenario testing. Performance benchmarks MUST be documented and maintained across versions.

**Compliance Monitoring**: Automated checks MUST validate code formatting, test coverage thresholds, and documentation completeness on every commit. Manual constitution compliance review required for architectural changes.

## Governance

Constitution supersedes all other development practices. All pull requests MUST demonstrate compliance with these principles through explicit validation. Any complexity that violates simplicity principles MUST be architecturally justified with measurable benefits.

**Amendment Process**: Constitution changes require architectural review, impact assessment on existing codebase, and migration plan for non-compliant code. Version bumps follow semantic versioning with MAJOR for principle changes, MINOR for new sections, PATCH for clarifications.

**Compliance Review**: Weekly review of principle adherence through automated metrics and manual spot checks. Non-compliance issues MUST be addressed within one sprint cycle.
