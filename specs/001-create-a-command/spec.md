**Completed**: 2025-09-29  
**Status**: ✅ COMPLETED - Fully Implemented and Tested  
**Input**: User description: "Create a command-line application in Go that monitors GitHub user's starred repositories and displays changes between runs..."

## Execution Flow (main)
```
1. Parse user description from Input
   → ✅ Complete feature description provided
2. Extract key concepts from description
   → ✅ Identified: CLI interface, GitHub API integration, state persistence, change detection
3. For each unclear aspect:
   → No ambiguities requiring clarification
4. Fill User Scenarios & Testing section
   → ✅ Clear user workflows identified
5. Generate Functional Requirements
   → ✅ All requirements testable and specific
6. Identify Key Entities (if data involved)
   → ✅ Repository data and user state entities identified
7. Run Review Checklist
   → ✅ No implementation details, focused on user value
8. Return: SUCCESS (spec implemented and validated)
```

## Clarifications

### Session 2025-09-29
- Q: What are the acceptable response time limits for the CLI tool? → A: No strict time limit - best effort with progress indicators
- Q: How should the application manage GitHub authentication tokens? → A: Support environment variable, config file, and interactive prompt
- Q: What should be the maximum number of starred repositories the tool is designed to handle effectively? → A: No hard limit - handle any number with pagination
- Q: How should the application handle state file maintenance over time? → A: Provide cleanup command but keep files by default
- Q: What level of operational information should the application capture? → A: Configurable: Allow users to set verbosity level (quiet/normal/verbose)

## User Scenarios & Testing

### Primary User Story
A developer wants to track which repositories they've newly starred on GitHub to stay updated on interesting projects. They run the CLI tool periodically (manually or via automation) to see only the repositories they've starred since the last check, avoiding the noise of viewing their entire starred list repeatedly.

### Acceptance Scenarios
1. **Given** no previous state file exists, **When** user runs the tool with a username, **Then** all currently starred repositories are saved as baseline and none are reported as "new"
2. **Given** a previous state file exists, **When** user runs the tool, **Then** only repositories starred since last run are displayed
3. **Given** user provides GitHub token, **When** tool accesses API, **Then** higher rate limits are used and private starred repositories are included
4. **Given** user specifies JSON output format, **When** tool displays results, **Then** structured data is output for programmatic consumption
5. **Given** GitHub API returns rate limit error, **When** tool encounters limit, **Then** appropriate error message is displayed with retry suggestions
6. **Given** user specifies custom state file path, **When** tool runs, **Then** state is persisted to specified location instead of default

### Edge Cases
- What happens when the GitHub user doesn't exist? (Clear error message with user verification)
- How does system handle network connectivity issues? (Graceful failure with actionable error messages)
- What if the state file is corrupted or invalid? (Rebuild from current state with warning)
- How does tool behave when user has thousands of starred repositories? (Efficient pagination handling)
- What happens if user unstars repositories between runs? (Only focus on newly starred, ignore removed)

## Requirements

### Functional Requirements
- **FR-001**: System MUST accept GitHub username as required command-line argument
- **FR-002**: System MUST fetch user's currently starred repositories using GitHub API
- **FR-003**: System MUST persist repository data locally in structured format for comparison between runs
- **FR-004**: System MUST compare current starred repositories with previously stored data
- **FR-005**: System MUST display only newly starred repositories since last run
- **FR-006**: System MUST include for each repository: full name (owner/repo), description, star count, last update timestamp, and repository URL
- **FR-007**: System MUST support both authenticated and unauthenticated GitHub API access
- **FR-017**: System MUST support token input via environment variable (GITHUB_TOKEN), config file, and interactive prompt
- **FR-008**: System MUST implement proper error handling for API failures and rate limiting
- **FR-009**: System MUST support configurable output formats (JSON and human-readable text)
- **FR-010**: System MUST allow custom state file location specification
- **FR-011**: System MUST exit with appropriate status codes indicating success or failure type
- **FR-012**: System MUST provide configurable logging with verbosity levels (quiet/normal/verbose) for debugging and monitoring
- **FR-013**: System MUST handle GitHub API pagination for users with any number of starred repositories without hard limits
- **FR-016**: System MUST display progress indicators for operations taking longer than 2 seconds
- **FR-014**: System MUST gracefully handle network timeouts and connectivity issues
- **FR-015**: System MUST validate GitHub username format before API calls
- **FR-018**: System MUST provide a cleanup command to remove old state files while preserving files by default

### Key Entities
- **Repository**: Represents a starred GitHub repository with attributes: full name, description, star count, last updated timestamp, URL, and starred timestamp
- **UserState**: Represents the persisted state containing previously seen starred repositories and metadata like last check timestamp and username
- **APIResponse**: Represents structured data returned from GitHub API calls including pagination information and rate limit status
