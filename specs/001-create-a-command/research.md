# Research: GitHub Stars Monitor CLI

## GitHub API Integration

**Decision**: Use GitHub REST API v3 with go-github client library
**Rationale**: 
- REST API v3 provides stable starred repositories endpoint with pagination
- go-github is the official Go client with built-in rate limiting and retry logic
- Simpler than GraphQL for this specific use case
- Well-documented authentication flows (token, OAuth)

**Alternatives considered**:
- GitHub GraphQL API v4: More complex for simple starred repo fetching
- Direct HTTP calls: Would require reimplementing rate limiting and pagination
- Unofficial clients: Less reliable and community support

## State Persistence Strategy

**Decision**: JSON file storage with atomic writes and backup rotation
**Rationale**:
- Simple, human-readable format for debugging
- No external database dependencies
- Atomic writes prevent corruption during interruption
- Constitutional requirement for structured format compliance

**Alternatives considered**:
- SQLite: Overkill for simple key-value state storage
- YAML: More complex parsing, no significant benefit over JSON
- Binary formats: Not human-readable, harder to debug

## Authentication Management

**Decision**: Multi-tier token discovery with secure storage
**Rationale**:
- Environment variables for CI/CD and automation scenarios
- OS keychain for secure local storage per constitutional security standards
- Interactive prompts for initial setup user experience
- Config file support for development environments

**Alternatives considered**:
- Command-line arguments only: Insecure, visible in process lists
- File-only storage: Less secure than OS keychain integration
- OAuth flow: Too complex for CLI tool, requires web server

## CLI Framework Selection

**Decision**: Cobra CLI framework with standardized flag patterns
**Rationale**:
- Industry standard for Go CLI applications
- Built-in help generation and flag validation
- Consistent flag patterns align with constitutional UX requirements
- Supports subcommands for future extensibility (cleanup, config)

**Alternatives considered**:
- Standard flag package: Too low-level, would require reimplementing help/validation
- urfave/cli: Less popular, fewer features than Cobra
- Custom implementation: Violates constitutional simplicity principles

## Progress Indication Strategy

**Decision**: Text-based progress bars with operation status
**Rationale**:
- Constitutional requirement for >2 second operations
- Works in both interactive and non-interactive environments
- Provides meaningful feedback for API pagination progress
- Compatible with JSON output mode (stderr vs stdout separation)

**Alternatives considered**:
- Spinner indicators: Less informative about actual progress
- No progress indication: Violates constitutional UX requirements
- GUI progress: Inappropriate for CLI tool

## Rate Limiting Approach

**Decision**: Exponential backoff with jitter and respect for GitHub rate limit headers
**Rationale**:
- Constitutional requirement for rate limit compliance
- GitHub provides rate limit status in response headers
- Exponential backoff prevents thundering herd issues
- Jitter reduces synchronized retry attempts

**Alternatives considered**:
- Fixed delay retry: Less efficient, may still exceed limits
- No retry logic: Poor user experience, violates constitutional reliability
- Client-side rate limiting: Complex to implement correctly

## Error Handling Philosophy

**Decision**: Structured error types with actionable user messages
**Rationale**:
- Constitutional requirement for actionable error messages
- Go idioms favor explicit error handling
- Different error types enable appropriate user guidance
- Supports both human and machine-readable error output

**Alternatives considered**:
- Generic error messages: Violates constitutional UX requirements
- Panic-based error handling: Not idiomatic Go, poor user experience
- Silent failures: Unacceptable for monitoring tool reliability

## Testing Strategy

**Decision**: Three-tier testing with mocked external dependencies
**Rationale**:
- Constitutional requirement for 90%+ coverage with meaningful assertions
- Contract tests validate interface behaviors
- Integration tests verify real GitHub API compatibility
- Unit tests ensure business logic correctness without external dependencies

**Alternatives considered**:
- Integration tests only: Slow, brittle, violates TDD principles
- Unit tests only: Insufficient coverage of API integration scenarios
- Manual testing only: Violates constitutional testing excellence principle
